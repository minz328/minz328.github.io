**Short Bio**

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [School of Computing](https://computing.unl.edu/) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/), supervised by [Dr. Qiang Liu](https://liuqiang12040913.github.io/index.html). Prior to joining UNL, I obtained both my master's degree and bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Engineering from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2023 and 2020, respectively. 
My research interests cover several areas, including Wireless Communication, Reinforcement Learning, Edge Computing and Computer Networks.
